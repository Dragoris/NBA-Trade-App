# NBA-Trade-App

This is a project I started to give me and my basketball nerd friends something to argue about on the internet! The goal of this app is to present what it sees as a "balanced" player trade between two teams and then allow users to vote on which team would "win" the hypethetical trade  (i.e get back better players than it sent away). Users can see, vote on, and in the not too distant future comment on, the trades that other users have created. 

This app is powered in real time with Google's Firebase Database. Trades are immediately saved and accessable to other users. Clicking on a saved traded will display it and make it available for further voting. Voting is only permitted to autherticated users and each trade can only be voted on once by any user.
